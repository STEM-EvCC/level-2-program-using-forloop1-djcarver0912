BIO: Here we have for loop. In this program, we are given a few lists and a few tasks. First, we are given the list of all the mission names. Second, we are given a list of the years the missions launched. Thirdly, we are given a list of true and false values, a true value representing a successful mission. So, with this information, we are tasked with outputting the number of successful missions, the number of total missions, the number of missions launched before 2000, and finally the success rate of those missions. More details in the algorithm. Thank you.
